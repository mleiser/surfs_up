# surfs_up

## Overview of the Analysis
  
### Purpose
  The purpose of the analysis is to determine the viability of having a surf shop in Oahu open year round.  This is done by querying and determining the summary statistics of June and December for Oahu.  

## Surfs_up Analysis Results
  ![June Temperature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46801182/184053701-e1d12cd7-db23-4027-84eb-91bff07ccd3a.png)

- Between the two months, the minimum temperature for December was 56 degrees while June's minimum was 64 degrees.
- The maximum temperature was about the same between the two months with December being 2 degrees lower than June's.
- Similarly, the average temperature between the 2 months was also very similar, with December being only 3 degrees lower on average than June's.
## Surfs_up Analysis Summary
  When looking at the results of the query, it's clear that it is possible to keep a surf shop open year round in Oahu.  This can be seen when looking at the difference in averages being pretty minimal for the most part.  The maximums are also fairly close with the minimum being very different but also not very uncomfortable enough to close up shop for December.  Another query that could be run on the data would be percipitation rates between December and June to determine rain frequency.  A second query would be to look at temperature differences for an entire year to determine temperature fluctuations better than just looking at 2 months.
